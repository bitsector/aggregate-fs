# Text File Aggregator

**BitSector 6.10.23**

## Introduction

Aggregate all readable text files in a path into the clipboard.

**Why should you care?**

1. To avoid manual copy-pasting from file to file.
2. To quickly dump all readable content into the clipboard.
3. Highly useful with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Make it easier for ChatGPT to read and process contents from multiple files.

## Ubuntu Version

> **Note**: If you're not using the zsh shell, replace `.zshrc` with `.bashrc` or your relevant `.*rc` file.

1. **Backup Your .zshrc**:

   ```bash
   cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.old
   ```

2. **Install xsel**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y xsel
   ```

3. **Add the Script to .zshrc**:

   ```bash
   [Your Ubuntu function here]
   ```

4. **Reload the Shell**:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. **Use the Function**:

   ```bash
   agg /path/to/dir/with/content/
   ```

6. **Heredoc Version for Quick Use**:

   ```bash
   [Your Ubuntu heredoc script here]
   ```

## MacOS Version

> **Note**: If you're not using the zsh shell, replace `.zshrc` with `.bashrc` or your respective `.*rc` file.

1. **Backup Your .zshrc**:

   ```bash
   cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.old
   ```

2. **Verify pbcopy is Installed**:

   ```bash
   which pbcopy
   ```

3. **Add the Script to .zshrc**:

   ```bash
   [Your MacOS function here]
   ```

4. **Reload the Shell**:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. **Use the Function**:

   ```bash
   agg /path/to/dir/with/content/
   ```

6. **Heredoc Version for Quick Use**:

   ```bash
   [Your MacOS heredoc script here]
   ```

## Final Notes

### Limitations

The clipboard size may be limited, leading to truncation of data. It's best to avoid copying overly large amounts of data. The exact limits vary, with some reporting as low as 4000 bytes and others as high as [1MB](https://github.com/astrand/xclip/issues/43).

To check your current clipboard size on Ubuntu:

```bash
echo "Clipboard size: $(xsel -b | wc -c) bytes, $(xsel -b | wc -m) characters"
```

As of this writing, ChatGPTâ€™s input limit stands at 4096 characters.
```

This format structures your information for better readability in Markdown. You can copy and paste this into your README.md or any markdown viewer.
