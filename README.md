# Text File Aggregator

BitSector 6.10.23

## Introduction

Aggregate all readable text files in a path into the clipboard.

Why should you care?

- To avoid manual copy-pasting from file to file.
- To quickly dump all readable content into the clipboard.
- Highly useful with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Make it easier for ChatGPT to read and process contents from multiple files.

## Final Notes

### Limitations

The clipboard size may be limited, leading to truncation of data. It's best to avoid copying overly large amounts of data. The exact limits vary, with some reporting as low as 4000 bytes and others as high as [1MB](https://github.com/astrand/xclip/issues/43).



To check your current clipboard size on Ubuntu:
echo "Clipboard size: $(xsel -b | wc -c) bytes, $(xsel -b | wc -m) characters"

As of this writing, ChatGPTâ€™s input limit stands at 4096 characters.
